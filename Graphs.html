          <p2>Figure 1. (Left) The Majority of the review scores are 4.0 or higher. The rating data skews to the right, meaning that the majority of the review scores will be higher.(Right) The pie chart also shows that 63% of all rating scores are 4 or greater.</p2>

          <p2>Figure 2. (Left) The top 10 highest rated breweries in the data base are around 4.5. (Right) However, there is a large discrepancy between the number of overall reviews the top rated breweries received. For example, the second highest rated brewery, The Alchemist Pub & Brewery, has the least amount of reviews. </p2>

          <p2>Figure 3. (Left) The top 10 highest rated beer types range in the low 4.0s. (Left) The highest rated beer type, American Wild Ale, was also the most rated beer type. Number of reviews seems less associated to review score in beer type than breweries. </p2>

            <p2>Figure 4. The average ABV for this dataset is around 8%. However, there are a large number of outliers both at the lower and higher end of the ABV range. </p2>

              <p2>Figure 5. The above is the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) that plots the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR). TPR represents the probability of detection. The FPR represents the probability of a false alarm. The diagonal line represents where points would fall in the model if it were randomly guessing; therefore, not fitting the data well. Points above the diagonal line represent good classification results from the logistic regression model.  </p2>

              <p2>Figure 6. Precision represents the ration of the number of true positives to the sum of the numbers of true and false positives. Recall represents the sensitivity of the model and is the ratio of the number of true positives to the number of actual positives. The highest possible f-score is 1.0 which indicates perfect precision and recall. Support represents the number of each category in y-test.</p2>
